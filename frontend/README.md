# UBA Frontend (simple React + Vite)

This is a minimal frontend prototype for the Cognitive UBA project. It uses Vite + React and a mock API for development.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "f:\Graduation projet\Graduation project_front"
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app shows a simple home hero page and a dashboard with users, alerts, search/filter and a small trend chart.
